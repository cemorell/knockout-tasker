#The Morell Holiday Tasker made in KnockoutJS:

in order for the SASS to convert to CSS

## New To Knockout
Had fun exploring this new library/framework. A lot less structured than React and Angular which is good and bad. In such a simple app, this is so lightweight and provides a lot of freedom. However, in a larger scale application, I might go for React. Just trying out another tool here!

## Problems that arose
Mostly I really would like to add Firebase. I tried for almost an hour but documentation for knockout and firebase is light. However given another couple hours, I think I could get it where it needs to be. Data binding seems fairly straightforward in Knockout. I think the documentation is probably the most logical in terms of data flow and very light structure. The MVVM flow is still new but having used DOM before, not totally foreign. In sum, I'm positively a fan of KO and will be using again!!

Thanks!
